In this project I have build a real estate price prediction website. We build a model using sklearn and linear regression using pune home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Next we write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Lastly, we build a website using html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

Technology used are -

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
